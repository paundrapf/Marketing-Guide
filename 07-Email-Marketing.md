- High engagement vs low
- Purchased X vs purchased Y

Different Messaging

Free tier: "Upgrade to unlock..."

Impact

Segmented emails: 76% higher CTR vs broadcast.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TAKTIK 5 - PERSONALIZATION Levels

Level 1: Basic

"Hi [FirstName]" - Industry standard.

Level 2: Behavioral

"Hi [Name], noticed lo use [Feature] a lot. Here's advanced tips..."

Level 3: +30-50%

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TAKTIK 6 - STORY-BASED EMAILS

Konsep

Humans remember stories 22x better than facts. Use narrative untuk sell.

Structure

1. Hook (relatable situation)
2. Conflict (the problem)
3. Struggle (attempts to solve)
4. Resolution (found solution)
5. Lesson/CTA (how reader can too)

Contoh

Subject: "I almost quit building this"

Body:
"Gue pernah di titik mau give up.

6 bulan bikin bot, 3 bulan no users, burnout parah.

Hampir close project.

Tapi gue coba satu hal lagi: post di Twitter tentang perjalanan gue.

Thread viral. 50 sign-ups in 1 day.

Lesson: Transparency wins.

Lo punya product yang stuck? Let me help: [link to consultation/product]"

Power

Story bypasses skepticism. Facts tell, stories sell.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TAKTIK 7 - A/B TESTING

What to Test (Priority Order)

1. Subject line (biggest impact on open rate)
2. Send time
3. CTA (text, color, placement)
4. Email length (short vs long)
5. Personalization level
6. Images vs no images

How to Run

1. Split audience 50/50
2. Change ONE variable only
3. Wait for statistical significance (min 100 emails each)
4. Winner becomes new default
5. Test next variable

Subject Line Testing

Version A: "Quick question for you"
Version B: "[Name], quick question"

Track open rate. Winner by 2%+ = significant.

Tools

ConvertKit, Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign semua punya built-in A/B testing.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TAKTIK 8 - PRODUCT LAUNCH SEQUENCE

5-Email Sequence

Email 1 (7 days before): Problem awareness
"Here's what most people don't realize about [problem]..."

Email 2 (5 days before): Solution teaser
"We've been working on something that solves this..."

Email 3 (3 days before): Full reveal
"Introducing [Product]. Here's what it does..."

Email 4 (1 day before): Social proof + FAQ
"Early users are saying... Plus answers to common questions"

Email 5 (Launch day): Live announcement + scarcity
"We're LIVE! First 50 sign-ups get bonus..."

Add-on: Post-launch

Day 2: "Already 73 users joined, don't miss out"
Day 5: "Last chance - early bird ends tonight"

Result

Proper launch sequence = 3-5x more first-day sales vs single email.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TAKTIK 9 - NEWSLETTER STRATEGY

Value-First Philosophy

80% value, 20% sell. Give more than you ask.

Content Mix

- 1 key insight/lesson
- 1 curated resource
- 1 behind-the-scenes update
- 1 soft CTA (optional)

Structure

1. Personal opener (human touch)
2. Main content (the value)
3. Quick resources (links, tools)
4. Soft CTA (if relevant)
5. Personal sign-off

Frequency

Weekly = most common. Bi-weekly = also fine. Daily = for specific audiences only.

Growth

Newsletter = owned audience. Gak tergantung algorithm changes. Build it.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TAKTIK 10 - SCARCITY EMAILS

Types of Scarcity

1. Time-limited ("Ends at midnight")
2. Quantity-limited ("Only 50 spots")
3. Bonus-limited ("First 30 get extra X")
4. Price-limited ("Price increases tomorrow")

Email Sequence for Scarcity

Email 1: Announcement + deadline
Email 2: Reminder (50% time done)
Email 3: 24 hours left
Email 4: Final hours (URGENT)
Email 5: Last call (30 minutes)

Subject Lines

"Ending tonight: [Offer]"
"[Name], 24 hours left"
"FINAL: [Product] access closing"
"Last chance (literally)"

Warning

Scarcity must be REAL. Fake scarcity = destroyed trust forever.

If you say "only 50 spots", actually limit to 50.
